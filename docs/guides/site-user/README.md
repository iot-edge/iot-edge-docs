## Site User Guide {docsify-ignore}

This guide is for all users of the site. It introduces the main concepts and actions that any user can take.


## Annotations

Annotations are notes available on graphs in the dashboard. The look like this:

TODO: Insert annotation image

To view an annotation, hover your mouse or click the triangle at the bottom of the vertical line.

To edit or remove an existing annotation, click the edit icon in the annotation window.

If you see something on a graph worth mentioning you can add a note to that time on the graph. To add an annotation, press the CMD button and either click on a graph or drag across a time window on the graph. The annotation window will open, allowing you to enter your notes and optionally tag your notes with keyword tags.

Other dashboards can overlay annotations created with these tags, regardless of the chart the annotation was added to.
